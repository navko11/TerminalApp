T1A3 - Terminal Application - Mark Navarro

The project that I have decided to make is a replication of a simple payroll system.
The system will allow you to view/add/remove employees and input basic information of employees.
After all the inputs are declared with values, the result of the payslip of the employee will be displayed.

Python version 3.11.4

I had to input these commands in order to open virtual environment in my Windows system
1. python -m venv tutorial-env              
2. Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
3. tutorial-env\Scripts\activate
4. python main.py

Packages used:
pip install art
pip install colorama
